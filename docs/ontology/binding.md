# Binding — Core Design (v0)

Status: draft
Scope: the binding spec only — the YAML format that attaches a logical
ontology (see `ontology.md`) to physical tables and columns on a specific
backend.

## 1. Goals

- **Thin files.** A binding says *where* data lives, not *how* it is
  transformed.
- **One file per target.** One binding file per target, e.g. `(backend, deployment env)` pair. No conditional logic inside a file.
- **Backend-neutral shape.** Entity and relationship binding syntax is
  identical for BigQuery and Spanner; only the `target:` block differs.
- **Ontology-aware, ontology-unaware.** The binding references ontology
  names and never redeclares logical structure. The ontology file does not
  know bindings exist.

## 2. File shape

One file per target. Suffix: `*.binding.yaml`. Top-level key: `binding:`.
All YAML uses block style; flow style is equivalent.

```yaml
binding: finance-bq-prod
ontology: finance
target:
  backend: bigquery
  project: my-proj
  dataset: finance

entities:
  - name: Person
    source: raw.persons
    properties:
      - name: party_id
        column: person_id
      - name: name
        column: display_name
      - name: dob
        column: date_of_birth
      - name: first_name
        column: given_name
      - name: last_name
        column: family_name
      # full_name is derived (expr in ontology) — not listed here

  - name: Organization
    source: raw.organizations
    properties:
      - name: party_id
        column: org_id
      - name: name
        column: legal_name
      - name: tax_id
        column: ein

  - name: Account
    source: raw.accounts
    properties:
      - name: account_id
        column: acct_id
      - name: opened_at
        column: created_ts

  - name: Security
    source: ref.securities
    properties:
      - name: security_id
        column: cusip

relationships:
  - name: HOLDS
    source: raw.holdings
    from_columns:
      - account_id
    to_columns:
      - security_id
    properties:
      - name: as_of
        column: snapshot_date
      - name: quantity
        column: qty

  - name: TRANSFER
    source: raw.transactions
    from_columns:
      - src_account
    to_columns:
      - dst_account
    properties:
      - name: transaction_id
        column: txn_id
      - name: amount
        column: amount_usd
      - name: executed_at
        column: executed_ts
```

## 2a. Type overview

```yaml
# Binding  (top-level)
binding: <string>                       # required
ontology: <string>                      # required, must match the ontology's `ontology:` field
target: <Target>                        # required
entities: [<EntityBinding>, ...]        # optional
relationships: [<RelationshipBinding>, ...]  # optional
```

```yaml
# Target
backend: bigquery | spanner             # required
# BigQuery-specific:
project: <string>                       # required for bigquery
dataset: <string>                       # required for bigquery
# Spanner-specific:
instance: <string>                      # required for spanner
database: <string>                      # required for spanner
```

```yaml
# EntityBinding
name: <string>                          # required, names an entity in the ontology
source: <string>                        # required
properties: [<PropertyBinding>, ...]    # required
```

```yaml
# RelationshipBinding
name: <string>                          # required, names a relationship in the ontology
source: <string>                        # required
from_columns: [<string>, ...]           # required, non-empty, arity matches from-entity primary key
to_columns: [<string>, ...]             # required, non-empty, arity matches to-entity primary key
properties: [<PropertyBinding>, ...]    # optional
```

```yaml
# PropertyBinding
name: <string>                          # required, names a property declared on the entity/relationship
column: <string>                        # required
```

## 3. Target

BigQuery:

```yaml
target:
  backend: bigquery
  project: my-proj
  dataset: finance
```

Spanner:

```yaml
target:
  backend: spanner
  instance: my-instance
  database: finance
```

Source names in entity and relationship bindings resolve relative to the
target: for BigQuery, a bare `table` or `dataset.table` uses the target's
`project` / `dataset` as defaults; a fully-qualified
`project.dataset.table` overrides them. For Spanner, a bare `table`
resolves against the target database. Views are valid sources for both.

## 4. Entity binding

- `name` must name an entity declared in the ontology.
- `source` is the physical table or view. For row filtering (e.g.
  `type = 'customer'`), build a view in the warehouse and bind to it.
- `properties` must list one `PropertyBinding` for every **non-derived**
  ontology property on the entity, including those inherited from parents
  (inheritance is flattened at binding time). Derived properties — those
  with `expr:` in the ontology — **must not** appear; the compiler
  substitutes their referenced property names with bound columns.
- **Primary keys are implicit.** The ontology's `keys.primary` names
  properties; those property bindings supply the physical columns.

## 5. Relationship binding

- `name` must name a relationship declared in the ontology.
- `source` is the physical edge table or view.
- `from_columns` and `to_columns` name the columns in `source` that hold
  the source/target endpoint keys. Their arity must equal the endpoint
  entity's `keys.primary` arity.
- `properties` binds the relationship's own non-derived properties, same
  rules as §4.

How endpoint substitutability (e.g. `HOLDS.from = Account` with both
`Account` and `SavingsAccount` bound) lowers to backend DDL — one edge
table, many edge tables, label-referenced edges, or a union view — is a
compilation concern, out of scope here.

## 6. Derived properties

Properties with `expr:` in the ontology are never listed in the binding.
At DDL emission the compiler substitutes each referenced property name
with its bound column. A reference to a property that is not bound in this
environment is a compile-time error.

## 7. Partial bindings

A binding realizes a **subset** of the ontology. An entity or relationship
may be:

1. **Absent from the binding** — not realized in this target; no DDL emitted.
2. **Listed with a `source`** — realized.

A logical parent may remain unbound while concrete children are bound;
queries against the parent's label resolve against the bound children via
substitutability (lowering is the compilation layer's job).

Constraint: if a relationship is bound, both endpoint entities must have
at least one bound descendant (including themselves) in this binding —
otherwise the edge has nothing to point at.

## 8. Type compatibility with the target

The ontology is backend-neutral; the binding enforces target compatibility.

- **BigQuery** supports all 11 logical types in `ontology.md` §7.
- **Spanner** does not support `time` or `datetime`. A binding that
  exposes either on a Spanner target fails validation.

No implicit coercion. If the physical column type does not match the
logical property type, fix it upstream (a view, or land the data
correctly).

## 9. Validation rules

1. `binding` and `ontology` are non-empty strings.
2. The ontology named by `ontology:` exists and loads without errors.
3. `target.backend` is supported; backend-specific required fields are
   present.
4. Every `EntityBinding.name` names an entity declared in the ontology.
5. Every `RelationshipBinding.name` names a relationship declared in the
   ontology.
6. No duplicate entity or relationship names within the binding.
7. For every bound entity, every non-derived property (including
   inherited) has exactly one `PropertyBinding` with a non-empty `column`.
8. No `PropertyBinding` names a derived property.
9. No `PropertyBinding` names a property not declared on the entity or
   relationship (after inheritance flattening).
10. For every bound relationship: `from_columns` length equals the `from`
    entity's `keys.primary` length; same for `to_columns` and `to`.
11. For every bound relationship: the `from` and `to` entities each have
    at least one bound descendant (including themselves).
12. For the Spanner target, no bound property has logical type `time` or
    `datetime`.
13. Unknown YAML keys anywhere are a validation error (`extra="forbid"`).

## 10. Relationship to ontology

- Binding references ontology entities and relationships by name only; no
  schema redeclaration.
- The binding's `ontology: <name>` resolves, by default, to
  `<name>.ontology.yaml` in the same directory. A CLI flag can override
  the lookup path.

## 11. Open questions

- **Light casts in bindings.** Narrow `cast: <type>` field (→ `CAST(column
  AS type)`) vs. forcing users to a view. Revisit after first real use.
- **Strict vs. loose property coverage.** Currently strict: every
  non-derived property must be bound if the entity is bound. Loosening
  would allow exposing a subset. Wait for concrete demand.
- **Sources as SQL subqueries.** R2RML allows arbitrary SQL as a logical
  table. We disallow it here to keep transformation out of YAML.
  Reconsider if the rule proves onerous.
- **Multi-target-in-one-file.** Reconsider if users consistently ask for
  it.

## 12. Out of scope

- **Compilation and DDL emission**, including lowering strategies for
  inheritance substitutability (label-referenced edges, fan-out, union
  views).
- **Credentials** — authentication is out-of-band.
- **Transformation logic** — no arbitrary `expr:` in bindings; use views or
  dbt.
- **Composition of bindings** — shared defaults, multi-file assembly.
- **Measures** and **deployment** — separate docs.

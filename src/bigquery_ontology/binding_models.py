"""Pydantic models for binding YAML.

A binding document attaches a logical ontology (see ``ontology_models``)
to physical tables and columns on a specific backend. One file describes
one deployment target; it says *where* the data lives and never *how* it
is transformed.

These models capture shape only: required fields, enum membership,
unknown-key rejection, and list min-length constraints. Anything that
needs to consult the referenced ontology — checking that every
non-derived property is bound, that derived properties are *not* bound,
that relationship endpoint arities match the endpoint entity's primary
key, that bound types are representable on the target backend — belongs
to the binding loader, not here.

Only the BigQuery target is modeled today. Spanner lands alongside the
SDK's Spanner support.

"""Structured extraction registry for dedupe-safe context graph population.

Step 2 of the V5 Context Graph design: typed extractors that convert raw
agent telemetry events into ``ExtractedNode`` / ``ExtractedEdge`` instances
with explicit span-handling metadata.  Each extractor declares which spans
it fully or partially handles so downstream AI transcript construction can
skip already-covered data.

Typical usage::

    from bigquery_agent_analytics.structured_extraction import (
        run_structured_extractors,
        extract_bka_decision_event,
    )

    extractors = {'bka_decision': extract_bka_decision_event}
    result = run_structured_extractors(events, extractors, spec)

"""Tests for the ``gm`` CLI in ``src/ontology/cli.py``.

These tests favor **full-text** input/output comparisons over field-by-field
assertions. Each test embeds the entire YAML input as a literal string,
writes it to a temp file, invokes the CLI, and asserts against the exact
exit code plus the exact stdout / stderr text. That way each test reads
top-to-bottom as "given this exact YAML and these exact flags, you get
this exact result."

#      (``<ontology>.ontology.yaml`` next to the binding) and an

#      handle: exit 2 for "you gave me the wrong filesystem state",
#      exit 1 for "the YAML itself is wrong".
#   3. The ``file`` and ``rule`` fields in errors point at the file
#      that actually contains the mistake, so a user grepping their
#      editor can jump to the right line. This is non-trivial because
#      validating a binding transitively validates its ontology too.

# entity ``Thing`` with two stored properties (``id``, ``label``) —

# covers both properties so it's a "green" baseline that individual
